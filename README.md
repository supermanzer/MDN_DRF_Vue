# Mozilla Developer Network - Django Rest Framework - Vue.js


Whenever I am trying to learn a new element of web development in my full-stack journey, I like to have a well defined and not-too-trick project to base it on. For me, the Mozilla Developer Network [Django Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django) was the best help in getting me to really understand the Django web framework.  Because of this, I like to revisit it regularly as I try out different approaches to building web applications.  In addition to learning new things each time I review it, I find it helps me to have a set project with clearly defined goals that are broken out into easily completed steps.  For this repository I will be attempting to apply the following adjustments to the original tutorial project:

 * Create/Use custom User object for Authentication/Authorization 
 * Use Django REST Framework to expose a REST API rather than use built in templates
 * Create a simple Vue SPA front end to consume the REST API
